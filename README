Google chrome extension to add songs to your Rdio playlist. RdioFy.me works with Rdio¨.

Overview
--------
This extension uses the 3-legged Oauth authentication to your Rdio account. After doing the initial handshake of exchanging tokens, it loads your 
currently owned playlist and the most recently played song.
One can just click on the '+' link against a playlist name to add that song to that playlist. It's an one click solution to add your currently playing song to one of  your 
owned playlist. 

a) It is useful for people who listens to lot of recommendations and would like to easily add the song they are currently listening to, to a playlist of their choice.
b) Also, you have an option to create a new playlist and add the new son to it. 
c) You can search for songs, and it return the most common track for that query. You can then again add the song to the playlist of your choice or add another new playlist.
